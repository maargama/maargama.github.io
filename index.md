I am a PhD researcher at [COSIC, KU Leuven](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/) under the supervision of [Nigel Smart](https://nigelsmart.github.io/) and [Svetla Nikova](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/svetla-petkova-nikova/). 
My research interests revolve around the applications and practical aspects of multiparty computation.

From March to August 2023, I did a research internship at Nokia Bell Labs in Antwerp, where I worked on delegating the computation of zero-knowledge proofs.

From July 2020 to May 2023, I was involved in the [SNIPPET project](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/project/snippet/), where I worked on the design of privacy-preserving market mechanisms for the p2p electricity market using multiparty computation.

Previously, I was a research assistant at [Instituto de Telecomunicações](https://www.it.pt/), working on quantum primitives for MPC protocols. 
Before that, I received my MSc in Applied Mathematics and my BSc in Physics from [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) in Lisbon, Portugal.
